usual,american,none,french fries,"Here's a simple recipe for making classic American-style French fries:

### Ingredients:
- Potatoes (preferably Russet or Yukon Gold), as many as you'd like
- Vegetable oil or peanut oil for frying
- Salt, to taste

### Equipment:
- Large, heavy-bottomed pot or deep fryer
- Thermometer (if not using a deep fryer)
- Slotted spoon or spider strainer
- Paper towels
- Knife and cutting board

### Instructions:

#### Step 1: Prepare the Potatoes
1. **Peel the Potatoes** (optional): Some people prefer to leave the skins on for added texture and flavor.
2. **Cut the Potatoes**: Slice the potatoes into strips about 1/4 to 1/2 inch thick. Try to keep them uniform in size for even cooking.
3. **Soak the Potatoes**: Place the cut potatoes in a large bowl of cold water and let them soak for at least 30 minutes. This step removes excess starch, which helps in making the fries crispier.

#### Step 2: Dry the Potatoes
1. **Drain the Water**: After soaking, drain the water and rinse the potatoes with fresh cold water.
2. **Dry Thoroughly**: Lay out some paper towels and spread the potatoes over them. Pat them dry with additional paper towels. It's important to remove as much moisture as possible to ensure crispiness.

#### Step 3: Heat the Oil
1. **Prepare the Oil**: Fill a large, heavy-bottomed pot or deep fryer with enough oil to submerge the potatoes. Heat the oil to 325°F (163°C). Use a thermometer to check the temperature if not using a deep fryer.
   
#### Step 4: First Fry (Blanching)
1. **Fry in Batches**: Add the potatoes in batches to the hot oil. Do not overcrowd the pot. Fry them for about 3 to 5 minutes per batch, or until they are soft but not browned.
2. **Remove and Drain**: Use a slotted spoon or spider strainer to remove the fries from the oil. Drain them on a plate lined with paper towels.

#### Step 5: Increase Oil Temperature
1. **Increase Heat**: Raise the oil temperature to 375°F (190°C) for the second frying.

#### Step 6: Second Fry (Crisping)
1. **Fry Again**: Once the oil reaches the higher temperature, add the blanched fries back in batches. Fry until they are golden and crispy, about 3 to 5 minutes.
2. **Drain and Season**: Remove the fries from the oil, drain them on fresh paper towels, and season with salt while they are still hot.

#### Step 7: Serve
1. **Serve Immediately**: Enjoy your crispy, golden French fries while they are hot! They are perfect as a side dish or with dipping sauces like ketchup or mayonnaise.

### Tips:
- **Consistency is Key**: Try to cut all your fries the same size for even cooking.
- **Double Fry**: This method (blanching at a lower temperature, then crisping at a higher temperature) ensures the fries are cooked through and crispy on the outside.
- **Avoid Crowding**: Fry in small batches to keep the oil temperature from dropping and to ensure each fry cooks evenly.
